# 3D Wireframe Viewer with Shading

This is a basic 3D viewer written in Python using only 2D graphics (`tkinter`). It reads a 3D object from a `.txt` file, renders it as a wireframe, and optionally displays shaded faces based on their orientation to the camera.

## Features
- Rotatable 3D model using mouse drag
- Part 1: Wireframe display with vertex dots
- Part 2: Shaded triangle faces with lighting effect
- Toggle between modes with a button

## File Format 
`object.txt`
